It was designed by Urban Design Group of Denver, Colorado, headed by architect Peter Dominic, Jr. It is 200,000 ft.² with 181 rooms including studios, one, and two bedroom units for the Disney Vacation Club.When the East met the West with the completion of the rail line, it opened up a whole lot of opportunity to see the serenity and beauty along with adventure of the great outdoors, Railroad Hotels provided the first lodging in this new frontier. As if the elements were found right in the Northwest, the exterior is a stone foundation with lower Cedar Shake and upper Board and Batten siding. The interior, with post and beam engineering style made of Lodgepole Pine Logs, is a simple construction technique representing the fast pace, Rough-Rider era.The five story atrium lobby has an octagon shape in tribute to railroad industries roundhouse, a method of moving rolling stock from one line to another.The early settlers of the American West established a tradition of craftsmanship which often is characterized as Folk Art.  This rustic detailing can be found in the wood carvings in the lobby portraying the wildlife found in the west from the American grizzly to the salmon. Native American storytelling is found drawn along the first banister by placing the seasonal moons in relationship to the four compass points; North equals winter and south equals summer.Outside on the porch, the furniture portrays a style as if made from sticks or natural elements. Inside, tables give the illusion that they were all handmade with different poles of wood. The lobby and rooms have mixed-matched furniture and also use calicoes and broadcloth fabrics to represent many of the early settlers' materials from the East.  They brought their own materials with them, but they left behind the old stuff as a start a new life in the west.",

    "content": "Add the two totem poles in the lobby, the Raven and the Eagle, plus the character totem pole in front of the Wildness Mercantile merchandise shop and you would have a structure as tall as a Disney's Hollywood Studios &#8220;Earffel Tower&#8221; which is close to 130 feet tall.Many myths and legends of the Native Americans were larger than life and so were the totems they carved to play homage to the symbols of their family clans. The Wilderness Lodge paid homage as well with two towering 55 foot totems known as Raven Pole and Eagle Pole. While the figures on these totems were not meant to be specific to any of the tribes, they are common to many tribes of the great Northwest.Artist Duane Pasco from Washington state, with the help of three assistants, created both the Raven and Eagle Totem Poles within six months time. The Poles are made from Dead Wood Cedars, and are each about 15 feet in diameter at the base. The sections were spliced up the middle to create the form. To get the overall height, each pole is made up of two Cedars on top of each other. As was expected, because there was considerable heart-rot inside, they had to be hollowed out, so Pasco reinforced the centers by splicing in new wood. When he finished, he had half-cylinders that were about 4 inches thick on each edge and about 1 foot thick in the center.Pasco and his assistants began cutting away material with chainsaws. But soon, they were working with tools capable of much finer details: adzes, knives, and other traditional carving tools. After the polls were carved, they were finished with water seal and then painted. Shipped from the state of Washington and in four sections, it took five days to install and they are attached to two opposite sides but not directly across from each other of the open atrium lobby.The Raven Pole culminates with the story of how the Raven pulled the moon, the stars, and the sun from the box to light up the world of darkness. At the bottom sits Whale Chief, whom, according to some myths, held an archery contest with a tiny Wren won the hand of the Whale Chief's beautiful daughter, dolphin. You also find the supernatural cubs of Hooits, the Bear Chief. These two had the power to live as bears or humans, but whenever disguised as humans, they held the faces of small bears in their hands. Did you ever wonder why salmon return to the very river where they were born? Well, as Raven Pole explains, it's because Frog, the Great Communicator, called them back to lay their eggs and be treated kindly by humans.At the bottom of the Eagle Pole, you can see bear cub emerging between the ears of Bear Chief, symbolizing, that in the Indian cultures, young ones are traditionally trained by their uncles. Above, Klu-kun, the mountain goat, protects the shield of copper, which Northwestern Indians considered the highest form of wealth. Mouse woman, peering from her home, is believed protect young people. In this myth, the raven released the first tiny humans by opening a clamshell with its powerful beak. Above Raven  sits beaver, the symbol of hard-working builders in the top of the Pole is Eagle, a helper to both animals and humans. Eagle, as protector, is aided by three watchmen, known as Teen-skeel, who keep their eyes open day and night, protecting all the village houses.",

    "content": "An essential task of the Plains Indian woman was the dressing of hides. The articles made of hides-buffalo, elk, deer, antelope, and smaller game-made up the majority of the tribes earthly possessions.The tanning process began immediately after a successful hunt. The fresh skin was stretched out on the ground, hairy side down. If the hide was intended for winter wear, the hair was left in place. If it was intended to be used for summer clothing or tepee making, the hair was scraped off. The tanning fluid is basically a concoction of the brains, liver, and fat of the animal. However, the softening of the skin was accomplished less by any chemical action than by flexing and by stretching many times through a hole in a buffalo shoulder-blade bone. Finally, after drying, the hide was smoked over a fire. It usually took a Native American woman about six days to complete the tanning.  However, this might be only the beginning of her work, for the hide was likely to be cut up and stitched into any number of articles and then decorated with porcupine quills, beads, and other ornaments.",

    "content": "Within the first few weeks after the birth of her baby, the Native American mother would begin to lace him or her into a cradleboard, a wooden frame with a soft skin pouch, which could be carried on the woman's back.  The cradleboard was a versatile device. It could be hooked onto a saddle or strapped to a travois; it could be hung up inside a tepee or, if the mother was working outdoors, leaned against the lodge covering.   In any of these positions, it had one advantage over the settlers crib or baby carriage: long before he or she could set up, the Native American baby was able to see and view the world and the coming and goings of other people in an upright posture. Even when the baby was not on the board, it was often upright, for its mother might carry it on her back in a blanket. The cradleboard was usually made by a close family member in exchange for a horse or other valuable item. The wooden frame of the cradleboard was constructed to protect the baby should it fall.  Disney's Wilderness Lodge's collection of cradleboard consists of a sampling of the craftsmanship and technique from a number of Native American Indian tribes.

    "content": "There are artifacts from a variety of Native American tribes, including the Cheyenne, Crow, Sioux, and Blackfoot, that have been studied, recreated, and are on display throughout the lodge.  Settlers, amazed by the Native Americans' craft and design capabilities, often asked them where they obtain their patterns for the many designs are used on leggings, armbands, moccasins, etc., and how they transformed the patterns to the skins.  It was a question that often puzzled the Native American women, for the designs were simply in their own minds; they never had patterns.  They just worked them out as they went along, and they were always in perfect balance.Head Dresses: Head dresses, like all of the other objects used and worn by the Native Americans, had to express their beliefs and assist them in the accomplishments of their goals. It was believed that a person acquired the powers of animals, birds, objects, and the elements by wearing or carrying these things. To gather additional wisdom, the wearer was advised to reflect on the spirits of the animals and birds and imitate their ways of life.The shape of a headdress was created to express its purpose. Four types, or styles, of headdresses were worn by the Mystic Warriors of the plains. There was the horned headdress, the golden eagle feather headdress, the hat or cap, which was a smaller type of covering than the horn or feathered bonnets, and the animal skin type, which employed the animal's skin in something akin to its natural state. All other varieties could be placed in subdivisions of one or the other of these categories.The buffalo horn headdress is less well-known today than the regal eaglefeather bonnet, yet it held the highest position in the eyes the Native American warriors. The Eaglefeather bonnet was composed of individual feathers each with a distinct reference to the deeds of its warrior-owner. The Buffalo horn headdress was worn only during certain ceremonies. According to George Catlin, a survey artist who did many illustrations inspired by the North American Indians he encountered in expeditions West, only a few of the highest ranking warriors in each band were given the right to wear one by the village leaders.",

There are 728 rooms including unique bunkbed style rooms and suites.U.S. President Teddy Roosevelt’s promise became a reality by protecting and preserving our nation's natural resources.

If placed end-to-end, the wood would stretch for forty miles.The atrium, or lobby, which serves as a centerpiece, is over seven stories tall.Disney Craftsman William Robertson carved Northwestern wildlife on the log bundle columns. There are 16 figures carved from Lodgepole Pine and each is placed according to its life station, with a bird of prey on the top of each column including two different looks of the American Bald Eagle. The 12 foot tall totem of Disney characters stands adjacent to Wilderness Lodge Mercantile.
