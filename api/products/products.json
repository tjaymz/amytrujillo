It was designed by Urban Design Group of Denver, Colorado, headed by architect Peter Dominic, Jr. It is 200,000 ft.\u00b2 with 181 rooms including studios, one, and two bedroom units for the Disney Vacation Club.\nWhen the East met the West with the completion of the rail line, it opened up a whole lot of opportunity to see the serenity and beauty along with adventure of the great outdoors, Railroad Hotels provided the first lodging in this new frontier. As if\u00a0the elements were found right in the Northwest, the exterior is a stone foundation with lower Cedar Shake and upper Board and Batten siding. The interior, with post and beam engineering style made of Lodgepole Pine Logs, is a simple construction technique representing the fast pace, Rough-Rider era.\nThe five story atrium lobby has an octagon shape in tribute to railroad industries roundhouse, a method of moving rolling stock from one line to another.\nThe early settlers of the American West established\u00a0a tradition of craftsmanship which\u00a0often is\u00a0characterized as Folk Art. \u00a0This rustic detailing can be found in the wood carvings in the lobby\u00a0portraying the\u00a0wildlife found in the west from the American grizzly to the salmon. Native American storytelling is found drawn\u00a0along the first banister by placing the seasonal\u00a0moons in relationship to the four compass points; North equals winter and south equals summer.\nOutside on the porch, the furniture portrays\u00a0a\u00a0style as if made from sticks\u00a0or natural elements. Inside, tables give the illusion that they were all handmade with different poles\u00a0of wood. The lobby and rooms have mixed-matched furniture and also use calicoes and broadcloth fabrics to represent many of the early settlers' materials from the East. \u00a0They brought their own materials with them, but they left behind the old stuff as a start a new life in the west.\n",

The Wilderness Lodge paid homage\u00a0as well with two towering 55 foot totems known as Raven Pole\u00a0and Eagle Pole. While the figures on these totems\u00a0were not meant to be specific to any of the tribes, they are common to many tribes of the great Northwest.\nArtist Duane\u00a0Pasco from Washington state, with the help of three assistants, created both the Raven and Eagle Totem Poles within six months time. The Poles\u00a0are made from Dead Wood Cedars, and are each about 15 feet in diameter at the base. The sections were spliced up the middle to create the form. To get the overall height, each pole is made up of two Cedars\u00a0on top of each other. As was expected, because there was considerable heart-rot inside, they had to be hollowed out, so Pasco reinforced the centers by splicing in new wood. When he finished, he had half-cylinders that were about 4 inches thick on each edge\u00a0and about 1 foot thick in the center.\nPasco and his assistants began cutting away material with chainsaws. But soon, they were working with tools capable\u00a0of much finer details: adzes, knives, and other traditional carving tools. After the polls were carved, they were finished with water seal and then painted. Shipped from the state of Washington and in four sections, it took five days to install and they are attached to two opposite sides but not directly across from\u00a0each other of the open atrium lobby.\nThe Raven Pole culminates with the story of how the Raven pulled the moon, the stars, and the sun from the box to light up the world of darkness. At the bottom sits Whale\u00a0Chief, whom, according to some myths, held an archery contest with a tiny Wren\u00a0won the hand of the Whale Chief's\u00a0beautiful daughter, dolphin. You also find the supernatural cubs of Hooits, the Bear Chief. These two had\u00a0the power to live as bears or humans, but whenever\u00a0disguised as humans, they held the faces of small bears in their hands. Did you ever wonder why salmon return to the\u00a0very river where they were born? Well, as Raven Pole explains, it's because Frog, the Great Communicator, called them back to lay their\u00a0eggs and be treated kindly by humans.\nAt the bottom of the Eagle Pole, you can see bear cub emerging between the ears of Bear Chief,\u00a0symbolizing, that in the Indian cultures, young ones are traditionally trained by their uncles. Above, Klu-kun, the mountain goat, protects the shield of copper, which\u00a0Northwestern Indians considered the highest form of wealth. Mouse woman, peering\u00a0from her home, is believed protect young people. In this myth, the raven released the first tiny\u00a0humans by\u00a0opening a clamshell with its powerful beak. Above Raven \u00a0sits beaver, the symbol of hard-working builders in the top of the Pole\u00a0is Eagle,\u00a0a helper\u00a0to both animals and humans. Eagle, as protector, is aided by three watchmen, known as Teen-skeel, who keep their eyes open day and night, protecting all the village houses.\n",

The fresh skin was stretched out on the ground, hairy\u00a0side down. If the hide was intended for winter wear, the hair was left in place. If it was intended to be used for summer clothing or tepee making, the hair was scraped off. The\u00a0tanning fluid is basically a concoction of the brains, liver, and fat of the animal. However, the softening of the skin was accomplished less\u00a0by any chemical action than by flexing and by stretching many times through a hole in a buffalo shoulder-blade bone. Finally, after drying, the hide was smoked over a fire. It usually took a Native American woman about six days to complete the tanning. \u00a0However, this might be only the beginning of her work, for the hide\u00a0was likely to be cut up and stitched\u00a0into any number of articles and then decorated with porcupine quills, beads, and other ornaments.\n",
